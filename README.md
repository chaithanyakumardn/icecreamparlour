# icecreamparlour

•	Ice cream parlour is a Web Page that is built using HTML, CSS and PHP.

•	A working Registration and Login page is incorporated using PHP and the data is stored in a localhost database with the help of Xammp.


•	Reasons to why I’ve used PHP over Java for the Registration and Login page.
1.	Looking at the benefits provided by both Java and PHP, it’s clear they are both very powerful. However, many programmers that use both languages will tell you PHP is the       better choice
2.	The main reason programmers choose PHP over Java is the speed. It’s much faster to develop and PHP tends to have fewer issues when using shared hosting.

•	The Website template is acquired from http://www.freewebsitetemplates.com

•	To run the project, The folder “phpproject” must be copied into the installation directory of Xammp                                                  (i.e C:\xampp\htdocs\phpproject)

•	In the Xammp Control Panel, Apache and MySQL servers must be running for the project to work.

•	Final step is to run the following address in the desired browser localhost/phpproject/
